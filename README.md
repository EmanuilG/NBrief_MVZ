# NBrief_MVZ
Texts for a neurology outpatient clinic in Germany

It is the sequel to NBrief, the neurology department report software. As of March 2020 I work full-time in a neurology clinic and see only outpatients. MVZ stands for Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum, it is the outpatient clinic, that belongs to the hospital, where I worked as an attending physician. The NBrief_MVZ strives to be useful to me, and others of course.
